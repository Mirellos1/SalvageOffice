# Salvage Office Mod for Starsector 0.98a

This mod adds a new building (Industry) called the **Salvage Office**, which automates the process of reclaiming wrecks within your colony's star system.

## Features

* **Automatic Scanning & Collection:** Every 3 days, the building scans the system for derelicts, debris fields, and post-battle remains. It automatically collects **Fuel** and **Supplies** found during the process.
* **Hull Recovery:** Recovered ships are added to the colony's storage as D-hulls.
* **Smart Filtering:** The mod ignores mission-critical objects and non-playable ships (e.g., space stations).
* **Future Plans:** Extending the system to collect more types of resources.
* * The building consumes **Supplies** and **Fuel** for operation.

## In-Game Requirements (Planned)

To build the Salvage Office, the colony must have:

* **Heavy Industry** (or Orbital Works)
* **Patrol HQ** (or Military Base/High Command)

## Installation

1.  Download the mod folder.
2.  Copy the `SalvageOfficeMod` folder into the `mods` directory within your Starsector game folder.
3.  Activate the mod in the game launcher.
