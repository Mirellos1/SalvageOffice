My First Mod: SalvageOffice - Starcector 0.98a
Hey everyone! I'm excited to share my first mod for Starcector with you all – SalvageOffice!

What Does It Do?
SalvageOffice is a specialized building designed to automatically collect salvage from your system after battles. Once constructed, it scans for wrecks and debris on the battlefield and gathers them for you. The best part? You have a chance to recover D-modded ships, fuel, and valuable resources – all automatically!

Current Status
The mod is currently in early beta, so there's still plenty of development ahead. I'm actively working on improvements and balancing, and I expect significant changes as I continue refining it based on feedback.

Future Plans
Right now, the building recovers a fixed amount of materials regardless of the battle
